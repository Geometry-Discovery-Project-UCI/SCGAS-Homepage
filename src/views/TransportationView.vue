  <h2>Airports</h2>
  <p>
    The University of California at Irvine is centrally located in southern
    California. The most convenient and nearby airport is the John Wayne Orange
    County Airport (SNA) which is about a short 10-15 minute drive from campus.
    Most hotels in Irvine have shuttle services which can pick you up directly
    from SNA.

  <p>
    Two alternative airports are the Long Beach Airport (LGB), about a 30-minute
    drive from campus, and the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), about a
    50-minute drive away. If arriving from LAX, taxi service is available to
    Irvine which will cost approximately $100. Also there are many shuttle
    services which can take you from LAX to Irvine, for instance the

    the "general" $13 one-day permit allows you to park in both unmarked and AR
